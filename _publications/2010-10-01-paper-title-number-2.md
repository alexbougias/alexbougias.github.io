excerpt: 'We propose a structural model of sovereign debt valuation that explicitly incorporates the possibility of serial defaults (SDs). We derive analytically the firm stock and sovereign bond
prices for a government that can strategically default multiple times on its debt. Exploiting the informational content of the local stock and CDS market, we estimate the model using a two-stage maximum likelihood procedure in a sample of eight serial defaulting countries. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, SD risk is an important risk factor of sovereign bonds. Specifically, the SD premium is on average 60 basis points and accounts for 15% of the sovereign credit spread. The bond return distribution exhibits heavier tails under SD risk and implies higher portfolio losses due to market risk. On the contrary, SDs reduce the stock prices by only 20 basis points and do not affect their return distribution. Overall, our model resembles the documented stylized facts of serial defaulters and provides a new way of recovering investorsâ€™ expectatins about multiple defaults from the equity and credit derivatives market.'
