excerpt: 'In the barrier option model of corporate security valuation, the firm’s creditors impose a
default triggering barrier on the firm value to protect their claim. Two disputed issues in
the literature are whether the implied default barrier is positive, and whether it is above
or below the book value of the firm’s liabilities. We extend the model of Brockman and
Turtle (2003, Journal of Financial Economics 67, 511–529) by embedding asset
payouts in the valuation of shareholders’ equity. Using a sample of US stocks from the
NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ exchanges, our paper exploits market and firm
information to compute the implied default barrier for thirty 2-digit SIC groups, including
industrials and banks. Our results show that the implied default barrier is lower than it
is in the received literature, and it can be less than total liabilities, even zero for some
firms. The implied physical default probabilities are significantly lower in the presence
of payouts, providing a closer fit to the historical corporate default rates, particularly for
issuers of speculative-grade bonds.'

We show that the introduction of asset payouts in the barrier option model of corporate securities valuation lead to lower than leverage barriers and improves the estimation of corporate default probabilities.
